A smooth surface reflects <strong>more </strong>light than a rough surface</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Smoothness and Light Interaction:</strong> When light hits a smooth surface, the light waves travel in a parallel fashion and are reflected in a predictable direction. This is called specular reflection. Imagine bouncing a ball on a flat, polished floor - it bounces back in a straight line.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Roughness and Light Scattering:</strong> On a rough surface, the light waves encounter many tiny bumps and imperfections. These imperfections cause the light waves to scatter in many different directions. This is called diffuse reflection. Think of bouncing a ball on a bed of pebbles - it bounces back in many unpredictable directions.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","year":2021,"score":1,"article":null,"difficulty_level_name":"مبتدئ","difficulty_level":2,"answers_data":[{"answer1":"<p>TRUE</p>\r\n","is_correct":"false"},{"answer2":"<p>FALSE</p>\r\n","is_correct":"true"}]},{"title":"<p dir=\"rtl\" style=\"text-align: left;\">.
