The stem is the basic form of the word, without any prefixes or suffixes. Prefixes are added to the beginning of the stem to change its meaning or grammatical function.

For example, the suffix &quot;-er&quot; means &quot;person who does something,&quot; so the word &quot;teacher&quot; means &quot;person who teaches.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some examples of suffixes and their meanings:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>-er</strong>&nbsp;(person who does something): teacher, writer</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>-ing</strong>&nbsp;(present participle): talking, singing</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>-ed</strong>&nbsp;(past tense): walked, talked</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>-able</strong>&nbsp;(able to be): lovable, breakable</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>-ous</strong>&nbsp;(full of): dangerous, courageous</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n","year":2022,"score":1,"article":null,"difficulty_level_name":"متوسط","difficulty_level":3,"answers_data":[{"answer1":"<p>TRUE</p>\r\n","is_correct":"false"},{"answer2":"<p>FALSE</p>\r\n","is_correct":"true"}]},{"title":"<p>Things you use in cooking are ingredients.</p>\r\n","explain_answer":"","year":2022,"score":1,"article":null,"difficulty_level_name":"مبتدئ","difficulty_level":2,"answers_data":[{"answer1":"<p>TRUE</p>\r\n","is_correct":"true"},{"answer2":"<p>FALSE</p>\r\n","is_correct":"false"}]},{"title":"<p>Brine is a kind of salted liquid .</p>\r\n","explain_answer":"","year":2022,"score":1,"article":null,"difficulty_level_name":"مبتدئ","difficulty_level":2,"answers_data":[{"answer1":"<p>TRUE</p>\r\n","is_correct":"true"},{"answer2":"<p>FALSE</p>\r\n","is_correct":"false"}]},{"title":"<p>The sun is closer to the earth than the moon.</p>\r\n","explain_answer":"<p>The moon is much <strong>closer </strong>to <strong>Earth </strong>than the sun.
